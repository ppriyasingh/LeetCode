Overview
The brute force solution is to find all valid combinations of cards and then select the combination that gives us the maximum sum. To accomplish this, 
we can use a recursive approach. At each point, we choose a card either from the beginning or from the end of the array. Our base condition is when k 
cards are selected or when no cards are left to be selected. This solution results in TLE because it checks an exponential number of combinations (many of 
the same combinations would be checked more than once). We can optimize this solution by using a dynamic programming approach.

A key observation in this problem is that we need to select k cards from the beginning or end of the array. Thus no matter how many cards we choose from 
the beginning, in the end, we need to select two subarrays: one from the beginning, and one from the end, and their total lengths must be k (the only 
exception is when k = cardPoints.length, in that case, we'll select all cards). Thus after selecting the two arrays we will be left with a single subarray 
of length cardPoints.length - k. There are three ways we can select the cards:

1. Select all cards from the beginning.
2. Select all cards from the end.
3. Select some cards from the beginning and the rest from the end.
In all the above three cases we will be left with a subarray (in the end, in the beginning, or somewhere in the middle) after our selection. This can be 
better understood in the following illustration where we are selecting 3 cards from an array of 8 cards.
In addition to the dynamic programming approach, we can also take a sliding window approach. A sliding window is a standard programming pattern used in
many problems, including those related to finding the sum or the product of a subarray. In case you are not familiar with sliding windows, you can go 
through this article written by one of our LeetCode users: Sliding Window Problems for Beginners. In this article, we'll start by looking at the dynamic 
programming approach and discuss how to optimize its space complexity. After that, we will finish with the sliding window approach.

Approach 1: Dynamic Programming
Intuition

As we determined above, the k cards that we choose will form two contiguous subarrays: one at the start, and one at the end of the input array. If we 
choose i cards from the start (where i <= k) then we must choose k - i cards from the end. There are k different lengths the first array could be.

Since these k arrays are overlapping, we can calculate the prefix sum for each of the first k values, and then for each of the last k values (working from 
the end of the array, and going inwards). We will store these values in two arrays of size k.

We can then use these to efficiently check each possible way of selecting i cards from the start and k - i cards from the end.
Algorithm

Initialize two arrays of size k + 1, namely frontSetOfCards and rearSetOfCards to store the score (prefix sums) obtained by selecting the first i cards 
and the last i cards in the array.

We calculate the prefix sum (sum of 0 <= i <= k cards) for the first k cards frontSetOfCards[i + 1] = frontSetOfCards[i] + cardPoints[i] and the last k 
cards rearSetOfCards[i + 1] = cardPoints[n - i - 1] + rearSetOfCards[i].

Initialize maxScore to 0.

Iterate from i = 0 -> k. At each iteration, we determine the possible score by selecting i cards from the beginning of the array and k - i cards from the 
end (currentScore). If this score is greater than the maxScore then we update it.
*/
class Solution {
  // T(O): O(k)
  // S(O): O(k)
    public int maxScore(int[] cardPoints, int k) {
        int n = cardPoints.length;

        int[] frontSetOfCards = new int[k + 1];
        int[] rearSetOfCards = new int[k + 1];

        for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
            frontSetOfCards[i + 1] = cardPoints[i] + frontSetOfCards[i];
            rearSetOfCards[i + 1] = cardPoints[n - i - 1] + rearSetOfCards[i];
        }

        int maxScore = 0;
        // Each i represents the number of cards we take from the front.
        for (int i = 0; i <= k; i++) {
            int currentScore = frontSetOfCards[i] + rearSetOfCards[k - i];
            maxScore = Math.max(maxScore, currentScore);
        }
        
        return maxScore;
    }
}

/*
Approach 2: Dynamic Programming - Space Optimized
Intuition

In approach 1 we used two extra storage spaces (two arrays of size k) to store the total score that can be obtained by taking i cards from the respective 
end of the array.

Instead of pre-computing the arrays, we can calculate the total score while iterating over the array and store the total score in two variables (in place 
of the two arrays).

Algorithm

Initialize two variables, namely frontScore and rearScore to store the score obtained by selecting the first i cards and the last k - i cards in the
array.

frontScore is initialized to the sum of the first k cards in the array, and rearScore is initialized to 0.

Initialize maxScore to frontScore.

Iterate backwards from i = k - 1 -> 0. At each iteration, we calculate the score by selecting i cards from the beginning of the array and k - i cards 
from the end (currentScore). If this score is greater than maxScore, we update it.
*/
class Solution {
  // T(O): O(k)
  // S(O): O(1)
    public int maxScore(int[] cardPoints, int k) {
        int frontScore = 0;
        int rearScore = 0;
        int n = cardPoints.length;

        for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
            frontScore += cardPoints[i];
        }

        // take all k cards from the beginning
        int maxScore = frontScore;

        // take i from the beginning and k - i from the end
        for (int i = k - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            rearScore += cardPoints[n - (k - i)];
            frontScore -= cardPoints[i];
            int currentScore = rearScore + frontScore;
            maxScore = Math.max(maxScore, currentScore);
        }

        return maxScore;
    }
}

/*
Approach 3: Sliding Window
Intuition

In this problem, we must draw exactly k cards from the array in such a way that the score (sum of the cards) is maximized. After drawing k cards from the 
array cardPoints.length - k cards will remain in the array.

Another way that we could view the problem is that our objective is to choose cards from the beginning or end of the array in such a way that the sum of 
the remaining cards is minimized.

We can use a sliding window to find the subarray of size cardPoints.length - k that has the minimal sum. Subtracting this value from the total sum of all 
the cards will give us our answer. This is because no matter where the minimum subarray is located (in the beginning, the middle, or the end) the 
remaining cards must be selected under the given rule: in one step, you can take one card from the beginning or the end of the array.

Algorithm

1. Find the sum of all cards in the array and store it in a variable totalScore.
2. If k is equal to cardPoints.length, then return totalScore.
3. Initialize requiredSubarrayLength to cardPoints.length - k.
4. Initialize two variables: presentSubarrayScore and startingIndex to 0. This startingIndex marks the starting point of the subarray presently under
    consideration. Thus it keeps track of the length of the present subarray.
5. Initialize a variable minSubarrayScore to totalScore. When the algorithm completes, this variable will hold the smallest possible subarray score in the 
    input array.
6. Iterate over the array.
    At each iteration add the current card to presentSubarrayScore.
7. If the size of the subarray under consideration presentSubarrayLength is equal to the requiredSubarrayLength:
    Compare the score of the subarray presentSubarrayScore with the minSubarrayScore and modify the minSubarrayScore so that it stores the minimum 
    possible subarray sum.
    Subtract the current card from the presentSubarrayScore.
    Increment the startingIndex.
8. Subtract the minSubarrayScore from the totalScore to get the maximum total score that can be obtained by picking k cards from the beginning or the end 
    of the array. Return this value.

  // T(O): O(N), In the problem, we are iterating over the array of cards twice. So the time complexity will be O(2â‹…n) = O(n).
  // S(O): O(1)
    public int maxScore(int[] cardPoints, int k) {
        int startingIndex = 0;
        int presentSubarrayScore = 0;
        int n = cardPoints.length;
        int requiredSubarrayLength = n - k;
